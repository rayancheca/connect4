How to play:

The game starts with Red's turn.
Players click on a column to drop a disc. The disc will be colored either red or yellow depending on the current player's turn.
The game checks for a winner after every move. A player wins if they get four discs of their color in a row, either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.
If a player wins, an alert is displayed, and the page is reloaded for a new game.
